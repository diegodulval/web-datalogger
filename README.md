This project was created with part of my process to apply my knowledge in React.js/Redux/Javascript and I was applying the following aspects of this technologies. 

I built some features like, CRUD of products, categories, accessing API.

## Table of Contents

- [React](in general)
- [Redux](avoiding to maintain states inside the components)
- [Axios](For consuming the API)

## Requirements
* Node.js
* json-server
* Others will be added via `npm install`

## Installing

For install you just need to clone the project and then run the following commands:

* First of all install json-server `npm -g install json-server`
* Open a second tab of the terminal, enter in the folder of the db.json file and run `json-server --watch db.json --port 3001`
* In the other tab/window of terminal run `npm start` this command will run the app at the address `http://localhost:3000`.
